# Email Sender

I work at the Student Media Center at my college and while trying to implement new technologies into our daily services, I decided to make a web application that allows users to send personalized email templates to clients based on their information. The application enables multiple client entries and includes options for different email templates, including a confirmation for due dates.


## Features

- **Dynamic Email Forms**: Users can add multiple email forms to send personalized emails to different clients.
- **Input Fields**: Each form collects the client's name, email, equipment, and the selected email template.
- **Email Template Selection**: Choose from various predefined templates, including options for confirming due dates.
- **Conditional Logic**: If the "Due Date Confirmation" template is selected, users can specify if a due date is needed and input the date accordingly.
- **Remove Form Functionality**: Users can remove any added email forms (except the first one) as needed.
- **Responsive Design**: The application adjusts to different screen sizes for better usability.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsvee0120/SMC
   
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**

### Usage

1. **Fill Out the Form**: Enter the client's name, email address, and equipment in the provided fields.
2. **Select Email Template**: Choose an email template from the dropdown menu. If the "Due Date Confirmation" template is selected, specify if a due date is necessary.
3. **Add More Clients**: Click the "Add another template" button to create additional forms for other clients.
4. **Remove Forms**: If needed, use the "Remove Form" button to delete any added forms.
5. **Send Email**: Once all client information is entered, click the "Send Email" button to submit the form.

### Note

Make sure to implement the `send_email.php` file to handle the email sending process. This application only provides the front-end functionality for collecting the necessary information.
